\section{Introduction}

In our project we computed a ranking of the already discovered exoplanets in the pursuit of giving first sights of planets that could fit the role of next home for mankind.
Once the ranking is created, we would display it on a website, along with visualisations regarding the dataset.

We think that our study might interest companies, that want to raise people's curiosity around the topic of finding Earth-like planets, or simply astronomy enthusiast, that we can inspire with a new view.

The results of our work take form in two materials; the ranking dataset which features every exoplanet from the original dataset and, associated to each of them, a grade from 0 to 10 representing how suitable they would be as earth replacement.

%------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Preprocessing and Analysis}
The dataset~\cite{dataset} we used is from an archive hosted by the NASA exoplanet science institute which is operated by the California Institute of Technology. In the dataset there is data about \numprint{4056} exoplanets with \numprint{47} various attributes (e.g.\ temperature, star luminosity, distance). These attributes are used to determine the ``livability score'', since they influence, if humanity could survive on this planet.

As a first step we removed the columns, that contained irrelevant information for out task such as website links or different names of the exoplanet. Next step was to drop columns with high ration of missing data. In the column \verb|fpl_eccen| is \numprint[\%]{61.7} missing and in the column \verb|fst_spt| \numprint[\%]{66.3}. As a result only \numprint{20} columns left for the ranking, these attributes are deeply described in Figure~\ref{tab:att_desc}. Since the domain knowledge of physicists, astrologists and maybe even biologists is needed, we use all the attributes mentioned above for our experiments. For further experiments is supposed the consultation with specialist about the livability impact of each attribute in the dataset.

\section{Ranking}
The ranking is computed by evaluating the similarity of each exoplanet to the specs of planet Earth based on a the parameters we extracted beforehand such as the surface temperature of the planet, it’s gravity, it’s light exposition, etc. We believe that some parameters probably have a bigger impact than others on how ``livable`` an exoplanet is. For instance, the year of discovery of the planet is probably not as important as it's surface temperature or it's gravitational force. Therefore two rankings have been computed: There is one ranking that doesn't take into account the weight of the parameters, and one that does.

In the so-called weighted ranking, parameters will see themselves attributed a weight coefficient that goes from 0 to 10 , which influences the computed score and therefor results in a different rating. The importance factors that were associated with the attributes were introduced by our sense of understanding on what is important.

The Ranking is computed using the native python-embedded cosine similarity formula, where $u$ and $v$ are the vectors for on exoplanet data row, and $w$ the weight coefficient of a parameter.

\begin{align}
\text{cosine}(u,v) &= \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} u_iv_i  }{ \sqrt{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} u_i^2  } \sqrt{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} v_i^2  }} \label{eq:cosine}\\
\text{cosine}_{\text{weighted}}(u,v,w) &= \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (u_i-\overline{u_w})(v_i-\overline{v_w})  }{ \sqrt{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (u_i-\overline{u_w})^2  } \sqrt{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (v_i-\overline{v_w})^2  }} \label{eq:cosine_weighted} \\
\overline{u_w} &= \frac{ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} u_iw_i }{ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} w_i } \label{eq:weighted_mean}
\end{align}

%------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Webapp}
We then came up with a node.js web application to display the results of our ranking, This website uses native HTML/CSS/JS, a node.js templating engine to pass data to views as well as some data visualisation framework such as chart.js to make it easier to display our data.

The Webapp displays the ten first planets for both the weighted and unweighted ranking.
